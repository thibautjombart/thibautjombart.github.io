      <description>Context On the 8th May 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has notified the WHO of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. While the WHO and the international community seems to have reacted very quickly to the situation, data in the early stages of an outbreak are always scarce. As of the writing time of the post, WHO has published a timeline of counts of cases by dates of reporting, with a total of 27 cases (including confirmed, probable or suspected cases), reported over a period of 10 days (5th - 15th May 2018).</description>
