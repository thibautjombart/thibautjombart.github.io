      <description>I am a researcher in outbreak response analytics, with a background in biostatistics, population genetics, and R programming. I currently work as a lecturer in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. My research focusses on developing new methodologies and tools for understanding how infectious diseases spread, and how we can control them.
You can find my CV here, and my PhD thesis (in French) there.</description>

      <description>RECON learn Most of the training material I currently develop is hosted on the RECON learn platform. This includes lectures, praticals, and code gists.
Lectures  Introduction to phylogenetics Reproducibility using R Primer on statistical analysis of outbreaks Outbreak reconstruction using outbreaker2  Practicals  Phylogenetics using R Simulated Ebola response 1 Simulated Ebola response 2  
Podcasts I have started experimenting with podcast in 2018. Most podcasts are under the RECON R tips umbrella, but I also occasionally post other videos, typically population genetics / statistics.</description>

      <title>Ebola outbreak: what can we say with limited data?</title>

      <description>Context Disclaimer: this blog post only represents my views, and not that of my institution or my collaborators.
On the 8th May 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has notified the WHO of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. While the WHO and the international community seems to have reacted very quickly to the situation, data in the early stages of an outbreak are always scarce.</description>
