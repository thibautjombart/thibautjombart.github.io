      <description>I am a researcher in outbreak response analytics, with a background in biostatistics, population genetics, and R programming. I currently work as a lecturer in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. My research focusses on developing new methodologies and tools for understanding how infectious diseases spread, and how we can control them.
You can find my CV here, and my PhD thesis (in French) there.</description>

      <description>RECON learn Most of the training material I currently develop is hosted on the RECON learn platform. This includes lectures, praticals, and code gists.
Lectures  Introduction to phylogenetics Reproducibility using R Primer on statistical analysis of outbreaks Outbreak reconstruction using outbreaker2  Practicals  Phylogenetics using R Simulated Ebola response 1 Simulated Ebola response 2  
Podcasts I have started experimenting with podcast in 2018. Most podcasts are under the RECON R tips umbrella, but I also occasionally post other videos, typically population genetics / statistics.</description>

      <description>As of November 2017, I have decided to promote open, transparent publishing, i.e. publishing in which:
 papers are freely available to the community reviews are fully published referees are explicitly named  I no longer review for, edit for, or submit to journals which do no fulfil these criteria.
Statistics These were last updated on the 22-12-2017.

      <description>Using data from past outbreak: the serial interval We create a distribution of the serial interval (SI), i.e. the delays between primary and secondary symptom onsets, in Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). We start by converting previously estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the SI (WHO Ebola Response Team (2014) NEJM 371:1481–1495) to the parameters of a Gamma distribution:
library(epitrix) mu &amp;lt;- 15.3 # mean in days days sigma &amp;lt;- 9.</description>
