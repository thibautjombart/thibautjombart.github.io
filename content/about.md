I am a researcher in <em>outbreak response analytics</em>, with a background in
<em>biostatistics</em>, <em>population genetics</em>, and <em>R
programming</em>. My research focusses on developing new methodologies and tools
for understanding how infectious diseases spread, and how we can control them.

I wear several hats, including:

<ul>

<li>
Associate Professor in Outbreak Analytics at the <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>
</li>
<li>
Senior Lecturer in Genetic Analysis at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>
</li>
<li>
A member of the <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/UKPHRST">UK Public Health Rapid Support Team</a>
</li>
<li>
Founder and current President of the R Epidemics Consortium (<a href="https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org">RECON</a>), an NGO for
the development of free data analytics resources for health emergencies
</li>
<li>
Extreme metal vocalist (currently innactive).

### Outbreak response analytics

I am interested in developing a holistic approach to outbreak data analysis,
with a strong focus on emergency outbreak response context, in which analytics
directly inform public health decision making. Beyond infectious disease
modelling techniques used in academia, I focus on the development of operational
analysis tools, including reproducible and auditable data cleaning, interactive
data visualisation tools, and automated report generation systems. On a more
theoretical side, I am also interested in the estimation of key delay
distributions (e.g. incubation period, serial interval distribution), and in
robust estimations of transmissibility and the use of branching processes for
short term incidence forecasting.

I regularly deploy to outbreak responses in the field, or close to it. In 2019,
I will have spent a total of 6 months in DRC for the response to the Ebola
outbreak. I set up the analytics pipelines used first in BÃ©ni, then in Goma for
informing the leadership of the response on various aspects of the outbreak in
real time.





### Evidence synthesis approaches for epidemics analysis

Part of my research focusses on integrating epidemiological and genomic data for
analysing epidemics. I have pioneered the field of statistical outbreak
reconstruction by publishing <a
href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003457">outbreaker</a>
in 2014, the first tool integrating epidemiological and genomic data for
inferring who infects whom during an epidemic. I am supervising a PhD student on
this topic, who carries further the integration of multiple data sources for
outbreak reconstruction through the development of <a
href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2/">outbreaker2</a>. I am
also developing fast, scalable algorithms for outbreak detection by combining
various type of data including spatial, temporal, and genetic information on
reported cases.





### RECON: the R Epidemics Consortium

In September 2016, I have create the <em>R Epidemics Consortium</em>
([https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org)),
an international network of experts in infectious disease modelling, public
health, and software developers interested in creating the next generation
of tools for disease outbreak analysis using the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/).




### RECON learn

In December 2017, I have created [RECON learn](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/)
a platform for sharing free, open training material for epidemics analysis. This
includes a collection of lectures, practicals and case studies, most of which
are distributed under [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).




### Statistical genetics

My earlier research was mostly dedicated to developing multivariate approaches
(factorial methods, clustering algorithms), for exploring genetic data. I am
still involved in some of these aspects. I am the author of 
[adegenet](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/), a 
[popular](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/) R package for genetic/genomic data analysis. 
With [Zhian Kamvar](https://plantpathology.unl.edu/zhian-n-kamvar), I am also running a course on 
[data science for population genetic](https://www.prstatistics.com/course/reproducible-data-science-for-population-genetics-rdpg01/) 
with [PR statistics](https://www.prstatistics.com/).
