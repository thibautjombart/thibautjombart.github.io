## RECON learn

Most of the training material I currently develop is hosted on the [RECON
learn](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/) platform. This includes lectures,
praticals, and code gists.

#### Lectures

- [Introduction to phylogenetics](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/lecture-phylogenetics/)
- [Reproducibility using R](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/reproducibility/)
- [Primer on statistical analysis of outbreaks](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/outbreakstatsprimer/)
- [Outbreak reconstruction using *outbreaker2*](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/lectureoutbreaker2/)

#### Practicals

- [Phylogenetics using R](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/practical-phylogenetics/)
- [Simulated Ebola response 1](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/simulated-evd-early/)
- [Simulated Ebola response 2](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/post/practical-ebola-reconstruction/)

## Podcasts

I have started experimenting with podcast in 2018. Most podcasts are under the
RECON R tips umbrella, but I also occasionally post other videos, typically
population genetics / statistics.

#### RECON R tips

- [R tips annoucement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l680LGAmzs)
- [R tips 1: installing R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbezGA_Yle8)
- [R tips 2: using development versions of packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ADX-OPzdzA)
- [R tips 3: anonymising data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zx0aQNxatY)


#### Misc topics

- [Introduction to snapclust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl3cf0XHG7Q) (genetic clustering tool)

## The adegenet website

While I may not be able to update this website as often as I used to, the
[adegenet website](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/) still hosts quite a
few lectures and practicals in its
[documents](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/) section. For the most recent
version of the tutorials, check the [github
wiki](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/wiki/Tutorials).
