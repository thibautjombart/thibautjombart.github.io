               respected psychologist, Philip Zimbardo, examines how the human
               mind has the capacity to be infinitely caring or selfish, kind
               or cruel, creative or destructive. He challenges our conceptions
               of who we think we are, what we believe we will never do - and
               how and why almost any of us could be initiated into the ranks
               of evil doers.At the same time he describes the safeguards we
               can put in place to prevent ourselves from corrupting - or being
               corrupted by - others, and what sets some people apart as heroes
               and heroines, able to resist powerful pressures to go along with
               the group, and to refuse to be team players when personal
               integrity is at stake.Using the first in-depth analysis of his
               classic Stanford Prison Experiment, and his personal experiences
               as an expert witness for one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards,
               Zimbardo's stimulating and provocative book raises fundamental
               questions about the nature of good and evil, and how each one of
               us needs to be vigilant to prevent becoming trapped in the
               'Lucifer Effect', no matter what kind of character or morality
               we believe ourselves to have.The Lucifer Effect won the William
               James Book Award in 2008.",
